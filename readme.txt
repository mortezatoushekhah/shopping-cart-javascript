This project was built in Object-oriented paradigm (OOP) based upon objects (having both data and methods) that aims to incorporate the advantages of modularity and reusability. 

This shopping cart project was built with 3 main classes (View, Product, Storage).

The data must be read via products.json file which is a backend simulation with 8 product object.

I used Localstorage to save all data as a database.
